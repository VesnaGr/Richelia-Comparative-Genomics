3. GTDB-tk tree: A tree in Newick format used to generate Figure 1 in the manuscript.
4. Genome stats folder: Contains all scripts used to calculate genome statistics (coding regions, intergenic spacers, transposases, pseudogenes, insertion sequences) along with an R script to plot Figure 1 in the manuscript.
5. GC content folder: Includes a script that calculates GC content in coding sequences versus short and long intergenic regions, as well as an R script for plotting Figure 2.
6. Anvi'o folder: Contains scripts with all the commands used in Anvi'o to generate the pangenome, as well as all the files produced by the Anvi'o pangenomics workflow. Also includes a table with all annotations performed within Anvi'o.
