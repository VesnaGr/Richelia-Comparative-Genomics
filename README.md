# Richelia_Comparative_Genomics
This repository contains various analysis scripts, as well as intermediate data produced by those scripts, used in this study:""
The repository includes:
1. Prokka annotated genomes
2. Pseudofinder annotated genomes
3. GTDB-tk tree in newick format that was used to generate Figure 1 in the manuscript 
4. Folder Genome stats - all of the scripts used to calculate genome stats (coding, intergenic spacer, transposase, pseudogenes, insertion sequences) together with R script to plot Figure 1 in the manuscript
5. Folder GC concentent - script that calculates GC content in coding sequence vs short and long intergenic as well as R script for plotting Figure 2
6. Folder Anvi'o - script that containes all the commands used in anvi'o to generate pangenome as well as all the files produced by anvio pangenomics worklflow. Table with all of the annotations that we ran inside of anvio
